## Output Analyzing

#### 1. Look at the following output of a test in $\texttt{R}$.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dawranadeep/24FA_git/main/Practice_qns/img/samp1_t.png)

##### A. What test am I performing here?

One sample t test. (Hint: Check the top line)

##### B. How many observations are there in the data?

Since in one sample t test with n observations, the degrees of freedom is (n-1). Here, n=252.

##### C. What is the significance ($\alpha$) of the test?

$\alpha = 0.01$. Hint: Check the output that says (99 percent confidence interval).

##### D. Write down the null and alternate hypotheses.


$H_0: $\mu \leq 23$ vs $H_A: \mu$ > 23.

(Hint: Check the line: "alternative hypothesis: true mean is greater than 23". So, we are testing for the hypothised mean as 23 and our alternative is "$\geq$".)


##### E. What is the sample estimate of the parameter being tested here?

23.10 (Hint: Check the last line)

##### F. What is the conclusion of the test?

Since $p$-value (0.1693) > $\alpha = 0.01$, we can not reject $H_0$.

##### G. What is the associated confidence interval for the population parameter that is being tested?

99% CI = (22.85, $\infty$).




<br><br>

#### 2.  Now do the same for the following test. Also can you tell what the confidence interval is about?

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dawranadeep/24FA_git/main/Practice_qns/img/binom_2.png)


Here, we are performing the sign test, i.e., $H_0$: median (M) = some number vs $H_A$: median $\neq$ some number.

(Hint: binomial test will show you number of successes, number of trials, and the line "alternative hypotheses: .... not equal to" tells you that my alternative hypothesis is two sided).




The confidence interval (0.455, 0.587) is for the probability of success $p$. Since 0.5 is within the interval, we can not reject $H_0$. Alternatively, $p$ value < $\alpha$ also shows the failure to reject $H_0$.

## Conceptual Questions

#### 1. For a normal distribution with mean $10$ and variance $25$, what are the 3 quartiles and IQR?


Check the notes 03_Hypothesis_testing_updated.html, under normal distribution. The expression for first, second, and third quartile for a $\mathbb{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$ variable are:

$Q_1 = \mu - 0.674 * \sigma$.

$Q_2$ (median) = $\mu$.

$Q_3 = \mu + 0.674 * \sigma$.


Here $\mu$ = 10; $\sigma^2$ = 25 => $\sigma = 5$.

So, $Q_1 = 10 - 0.674 * 5$ = 6.65
$Q_2$ = 10.
$Q_3 = 10 + 0.674 * 5$ = 13.35

```{r}
10 - 0.67 * 5
10 + 0.67 * 5
```

#### 2. Suppose that for a normal distribution, the first and third quartiles are $10$ and $25$. What are the mean, variance, median, and IQR?


Flipping the above problem. Here you know the following:

$$Q_1 = \mu - 0.674 * \sigma = 10$$
$$Q_3 = \mu + 0.674 * \sigma = 25$$

First find the IQR. Recall, IQR = $Q_3 - Q_1$ = $25 - 10$ = 15.

Second, find the mean $\mu$. From the above two formulas, $\mu = 1/2 * (Q_1 + Q_3) = 1/2 * (10 + 25) = 17.5$.

```{r}
1/2 * (10 + 25)
```


Now, median = $\mu$ = 17.5.
Lastly, from the same notes under Normal distribution, you will find the formula:

$$IQR = 1.35 \sigma$$

Plug in all the values. 

$$15 = 1.35 * \sigma$$ => $\sigma = 15/1.35 = 11.11$.

=> $\sigma^2$ = 123.4321.





#### 3. For a one-sample t-test, match the alternate hypotheses, rejection regions, and confidence intervals. Here $T$ is the usual statistic for a one sample $t$-test for mean, and $t_{\alpha; \nu}$ is the usual notation  for critical score from a student's $t$ distribution.


| Alternate Hypothesis                  | Rejection Region                                    | Confidence Interval                           |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| <span style="color:blue"> 1. \( H_1: \mu > \mu_0 \)                | <span style="color:blue">A. \( |T| > t_{\alpha/2, n-1} \)                       | <span style="color:blue"> I. \( \left(-\infty, \bar{x} - t_{\alpha, n-1} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \right) \) |
| <span style="color:blue"> 2. \( H_1: \mu < \mu_0 \)                | <span style="color:blue"> B. \( T > t_{\alpha, n-1} \)                           | <span style="color:blue"> II. \( \left(\bar{x} - t_{\alpha/2, n-1} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}, \bar{x} + t_{\alpha/2, n-1} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \right) \) |
| <span style="color:blue">3. \( H_1: \mu \neq \mu_0 \)             | <span style="color:blue"> C. \( T < -t_{\alpha, n-1} \)                          | <span style="color:blue">III. \( \left(\bar{x} + t_{\alpha, n-1} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}, \infty \right) \) </span>|


Hint: 
  
  i. Check the symbol of the alternate hypothesis. Rejection region should have the same sign.
  ii. For one sided CI, if the alternate is $\geq$, you will see a $\inf$ in the right side of the CI. If alternate is $\leq$, you will see a $-\inf$ in the left side of the CI. For $\neq$, you will see two numbers like $(c_1, c_2)$.
  
Answer: 
  
  i. 1 - B - III
  ii. 2 - C - I
  iii. 3 - A - II



#### 4. What is the difference between a parametric estimation method and a nonparametric statistical method?
  
  
Parametric: We assume a distribution function and estimate the parameters within it. Example: under normality assumption, we estimate $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$.

Non-parametric: We don't assume any distribution function or parametric form of the shape of the distribution. It still has parameters to estimate.


#### 5. Is it a population or sample?

1. **A survey of 200 households' monthly electricity usage over Pensacola.**

This looks like a sample.

2. **I want to study UWF students' average blood pressure. I collect data on all the students from UWF.**

Since I am studying only the UWF students and I have their entire data, it is a population.


3. **I want to study the  average blood pressure of the Florida state university students. I collect data on all the students from UWF.**

I only have data from a subset (only UWF) from the entire population (all Florida state university students). Therefore, this is a sample.

4. **The annual median income over the counties from American Community survey data.**


Sample.

5. **Daily temperature data over the  Gulf of Mexico for 3 years.**

Depending on the context, there is no wrong answer. If I am interested in the ecology and environmental variables over the Gulf of Mexico and look at this $3$ years of temperature data, it is a population. If we are interested in the biodiversity data over the Atlantic and only collect samples from the Gulf of Mexico, this is an example of a sample.

## Data summarization

### Here is a data on mean arterial pressure (MAP) by sex:

```{r echo=F}
library(knitr)
kable(t(data.frame(
  MAP = c(82, 84 , 85, 88 , 92 , 93, 94 , 95 , 98 , 100 , 102 , 107 , 110 , 116 , 116),
  Sex = c("M" , "F" , "F" , "M" , "M" , "F" , "F" , "M" , "M" , "F" , "M" , "F" , "M" , "F" , "M" )
)))
```

#### 1. Calculate the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and range of MAP.


```{r}
MAP = c(82, 84 , 85, 88 , 92 , 93, 94 , 95 , 98 , 100 , 102 , 107 , 110 , 116 , 116)
mean(MAP)
median(MAP)
var(MAP)
sd(MAP)
max(MAP) - min(MAP)
```


#### 2. Calculate the quartiles and the IQR of MAP. Draw a boxplot of MAP.

```{r}
quantile(MAP, c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))
IQR(MAP)
```

#### 3. Calculate the upper and lower fence values for MAP. Checking by the fence values, are there evidence of outliers?

```{r}
#Q3 + 1.5 IQR
quantile(MAP, 0.75) + 1.5 * IQR(MAP)
quantile(MAP, 0.25) - 1.5 * IQR(MAP)
```

#### 4. <span style="color:red">Calculate the mean and variance only for $\texttt{Sex = M}$</span>.

```{r}
MAP = c(82, 84 , 85, 88 , 92 , 93, 94 , 95 , 98 , 100 , 102 , 107 , 110 , 116 , 116)
Sex = c("M" , "F" , "F" , "M" , "M" , "F" , "F" , "M" , "M" , "F" , "M" , "F" , "M" , "F" , "M" )

MAP_male = MAP[Sex =="M"]
mean(MAP_male)
var(MAP_male)
```

## Estimation and one sample test

### Use the $\texttt{BodyFat}$ data^[https://hbiostat.org/data/] data from HW1. Download it using:

```{r}
bodyfat_data = read.csv(url("https://hbiostat.org/data/repo/bodyfat.csv"))
```


#### 1. Can you reasonably estimate the population mean, variance, and the first quartile of the $\texttt{Density}$ (column name = *Density*) variable under normality assumption? Please justify your answer.

```{r}
dnsty = bodyfat_data$Density
mu = mean(dnsty)
sigsq = var(dnsty)
sig = sd(dnsty)
Q1 = mu - 0.674 * sig
cat("Mean=", mu, "\n",
    "Var=", sigsq, "\n",
    "First Quartile=", Q1)
```


#### 2. What are your reasonable estimates for the same under nonparametric method (or without a parametric assumption)? Please justify your answer.

Under nonparametric method, estimates of mean and variance will be the same.

The population first quartile would be estimated by the sample first quartile, given by the following:

```{r}
quantile(dnsty, 0.25)
```

#### 3. Perform a one sample $t$ test to test if the average biceps circumference (column name = *Biceps*) is less than 30. Take $\alpha = 0.05$.

$H_0$: ... $H_A$: ...

```{r}
biceps = bodyfat_data$Biceps
t.test(biceps, alternative = "less",
      conf.level = 1 -0.05, mu = 30)
```

<span style="color:red"> Fill the details in exam and HW </span>

#### 4. We are interested in median biceps circumference and we want to test if it is greater than $33.8$. How would you test? Take $\alpha = 0.05$.


$H_0$: Median bicep = 33.8 $H_A$: Median bicep > 33.8

We have to do the sign test here.


```{r}
positive_count = sum(biceps > 33.8)
negative_count = sum(biceps < 33.8)
binom.test(positive_count, positive_count + negative_count,
           alternative = "greater", conf.level = 1-0.05)
```





## Two sample test

### Load the following data about pulse rates before and after excercize from http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/ms212.txt


```{r}
pulse_data = read.table(url("http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/ms212.txt"), skip = 1)
colnames(pulse_data) =   c("Height","Weight"	  ,"Age"    ,"Gender"	  ,"Smokes"	  ,"Alcohol"	  ,"Exercise"  ,"Ran"  ,"Pulse1"	 ,"Pulse2"	  ,"Year"	)
pulse_data = pulse_data[complete.cases(pulse_data), ]
```



#### 1. Do a parametric test if there is a difference on the average pulse rate (column name = **Pulse1**) based on gender  (column name = **Gender**). Take $\alpha = 0.05$.


Two sample independent t test.

$H_0$: $\mu_1$ (Mean for Gender = 1) - $\mu_2$ = 0 vs $H_A$: $\mu_1 - \mu_2 \neq 0$.


```{r}
gender = pulse_data$Gender
pulse = pulse_data$Pulse1

t.test(pulse ~ gender, alternative = "two.sided",
       mu = 0, conf.level = 1-0.05)
```

<span style="color:red"> Fill in the conclusion and other details </span>

#### 2. Do a non-parametric test if there is a difference on the average pulse rate (column name = **Pulse1**) based on gender  (column name = **Gender**). Take $\alpha = 0.05$.


Wilcoxon rank sum test. $H_0$: $M_1$ (Median for Gender = 1) - $M_2$ = 0 vs $H_A$: $M_1 - M_2 \neq 0$.

```{r}
gender = pulse_data$Gender
pulse = pulse_data$Pulse1

wilcox.test(pulse ~ gender, alternative = "two.sided", mu = 0, conf.level = 1-0.05, exact=FALSE)
```


#### 3. Do a parametric test on the assumption that pulse rate after excercize (column name = **Pulse2**) is higher than pulse rate before excercize (column name = **Pulse1**). Take $\alpha = 0.05$.

Paired t test.


$H_0$:  $\mu_1 - \mu_2 \geq$  0.
$H_A$: $\mu_2 > \mu_1$ or $\mu_1 - \mu_2$ < 0.

```{r}
pulse1 = pulse_data$Pulse1
pulse2 = pulse_data$Pulse2

t.test(pulse1, pulse2, alternative = "less",
       mu = 0, paired=TRUE, conf.level = 1-0.05)
```



#### 4. Do a non-parametric test on the assumption that pulse rate after excercize (column name = **Pulse2**) is higher than pulse rate before excercize (column name = **Pulse1**). Take $\alpha = 0.05$.


Wilcoxon signed rank.

$H_0$:  $M_1 - M_2 \geq$  0.
$H_A$: $M_2 > M_1$ or $M_1 - M_2$ < 0.


```{r}
pulse1 = pulse_data$Pulse1
pulse2 = pulse_data$Pulse2

wilcox.test(pulse1, pulse2, alternative = "less",
       mu = 0, paired=TRUE, conf.level = 1-0.05, exact = FALSE)
```
